# Project Brief: ReelScout

**Core Goal:** Develop a system named "ReelScout" that leverages AI (specifically Google Gemini) to analyze Instagram Reels video content and generate insightful recommendations or summaries based on that content.

**Key Requirements:**

1.  **Instagram Integration:** Ability to fetch Reels video data from Instagram. This likely involves using an Instagram API or library.
2.  **Video Analysis:** Process video content (potentially audio and visual elements) to understand its subject matter, tone, and key information.
3.  **AI Processing:** Utilize Google Gemini models to perform the analysis and generate outputs (recommendations, summaries, etc.).
4.  **Output Generation:** Present the generated insights in a clear and useful format.

**Scope:**

*   **Initial Focus:** Proof-of-concept demonstrating the core workflow: fetch a Reel -> analyze with Gemini -> output insights.
*   **Future Considerations:** User interface, handling multiple Reels, different types of analysis (e.g., trend identification, content categorization), user accounts, error handling, scalability.

**Success Metrics:**

*   Successfully processing a sample Instagram Reel.
*   Generating relevant and coherent insights using Gemini.
*   Establishing a basic, repeatable workflow.
