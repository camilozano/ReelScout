# Progress: ReelScout

*(This document tracks what works, what's left, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.)*

**Current Status:** Initial CLI for collection download implemented; Bug fix applied (01 Apr 2025).

**What Works:**
*   Memory Bank structure established and populated.
*   Basic CLI (`reel_scout_cli.py`) using `click`.
*   Instagram login using session file (`src/instagram_client.py` with `instagrapi`).
*   Fetching user's saved collections.
*   Fetching media items within a selected collection.
*   Downloading video media items to a specified directory (`src/downloader.py`).
*   Saving metadata (including relative path, caption, URL) for processed items to `metadata.json`.
*   Option to skip video download and only collect metadata (`--skip-download` flag).

**What's Left to Build (High-Level):**
*   **Gemini Integration:**
    *   Install `google-generativeai` dependency.
    *   Implement Gemini API authentication.
    *   Determine video processing/upload requirements for Gemini.
    *   Add logic to send downloaded videos (or video data) to Gemini for analysis.
    *   Parse and display analysis results (e.g., add an `analyze` command to the CLI).
*   **Refinements:**
    *   More robust error handling (e.g., for API changes, network issues).
    *   Enhanced logging.
    *   Unit/integration tests.
    *   Potentially handle non-video media types differently if needed later.

**Known Issues:**
*   **FIXED (01 Apr 2025):** Pytest failure in `test_collect_success_custom_paths` due to `click.Path` validation checks failing before patches were active. Fixed by creating the temporary file/directory directly in the test setup instead of patching `os` functions.
*   **FIXED (01 Apr 2025):** `ValueError` during relative path calculation in `src/downloader.py` due to comparing absolute download path with relative base directory path. Fixed by resolving the base path to absolute in `reel_scout_cli.py`.
*   Potential instability due to reliance on unofficial Instagram API (`instagrapi`).
*   No Gemini analysis functionality yet.

**Decision Log:**
*   **01 Apr 2025:** Determined that patching `os.path.exists` and `os.access` was insufficient for `click.Path` validation in tests. Switched strategy to creating the necessary temporary file/directory using `tmp_path` fixture (`custom_session.touch()`, `custom_download.mkdir()`) to satisfy Click's checks directly.
*   **01 Apr 2025:** Decided to use `.resolve()` on the `download_dir` Path object in `reel_scout_cli.py` to ensure an absolute path is passed to the downloader function, fixing the `relative_to` error.
*   *(Implicit)* Chose `instagrapi` for Instagram interaction.
*   *(Implicit)* Chose `click` for CLI framework.
*   *(Implicit)* Chose `pathlib` for path operations.

*(This file will track the project's journey from concept to functional prototype and beyond.)*
