# ReelScout üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®

ReelScout helps you rediscover the amazing places hidden in your saved Instagram Reels collections! üìå

Ever save tons of travel Reels but struggle to remember the specific restaurants, viewpoints, or hidden gems mentioned? ReelScout uses AI to automatically analyze your saved collections and extract location data, making trip planning or revisiting cool spots a breeze. üå¨Ô∏è

## üéØ Core Aim

This tool aims to:

1.  Securely connect to your Instagram account.
2.  Access your saved post collections.
3.  Download the Reels from a selected collection.
4.  Analyze video captions and/or video content using Google Gemini AI üß† to identify specific locations mentioned.
5.  Output a structured list (like a CSV) linking each Reel to the locations found within it.
6.  (Bonus) Find corresponding Google Maps URLs for the identified locations. üìç

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works (The Plan)

1.  **Login:** Authenticate with Instagram using `instagrapi` and a session file.
2.  **Select:** Choose one of your saved Instagram collections.
3.  **Download:** Fetch and save the videos and their metadata (captions, URLs) locally.
4.  **Analyze:** Use Gemini AI to check captions and video content for location mentions.
5.  **Output:** Generate a data file (e.g., CSV) mapping Reels to locations.
6.  **Enhance:** (Optional) Add Google Maps links for discovered places.
7.  **Future UI:** Eventually, provide a simple interface to manage collections and view results. üñ•Ô∏è
